### Technical

- **Smart Contracts**: The Ideamarket smart contracts are available in the [ideamarket-contracts](https://github.com/Ideamarket/ideamarket-contracts) repository.
  
  See the [README](https://github.com/Ideamarket/ideamarket-contracts/blob/master/README.md) for more information regarding the repository's structure. Further technical documentation is available in our [technical documentation](https://docs.ideamarket.io/contracts/overview).

  There are three different networks for the Ideamarket contracts as can be seen in the `deployed` folder: `mainnet`, `rinkeby`, and `test`. Please do not use the `test` network as we are using it for internal development purposes which makes it unstable and prone to unannounced change. For development you can either use the contracts deployed on `rinkeby` or deploy the contracts yourself to a network of your choice.
  
- **Subgraph**: The subgraph is available in the [subgraph](https://github.com/Ideamarket/subgraph) repository.

  Public API endpoints (supporting *GraphiQL*):
  - `mainnet`: https://subgraph.backend.ideamarket.io:8080/subgraphs/name/Ideamarket/Ideamarket
  - `rinkeby`: https://subgraph-rinkeby.backend.ideamarket.io:8080/subgraphs/name/Ideamarket/IdeamarketRINKEBY

  For further technical documentation on altering and querying the subgraph see the official [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/introduction#what-the-graph-is) documentation.
  
- **Frontend**: The ideamarket.io frontend is not yet open source. Should your submission require changes to the frontend, please create a mini-frontend (preferably in React) to showcase your submission.

  Public frontends:
  - `mainnet`: [Mainnet App](https://ideamarket.io)
  - `rinkeby`: [Rinkeby App](https://rinkeby.ideamarket.io)

- **Judging criteria**: The Ideamarket team will judge submissions by both code and visual quality, complexity, and creativity.
